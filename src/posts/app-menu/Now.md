This post is inspired from [The /now page movement](https://sive.rs/nowff)

The motivation behind this post is having a reminder for myself to be more focused with public declaration of my priorities.

## What is my heart into?

- Techology
- Programming
- Software architectures
- System design
- Badminton
- Travelling
- Hackathons

## What tech stack do I know?

- Deep dive into system design
- Give more tech talks
- More open source contributions
- Open source and ship the static site generator tool which I am developing. (This site is created using the same tool)

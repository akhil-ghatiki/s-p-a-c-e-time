This post is inspired from [The /now page movement](https://sive.rs/nowff)

The motivation behind this post is having a reminder for myself to be more focused with public declaration of my priorities.

If I’m doing something that’s not on my list, is it something I want to add, or something I want to stop?

## What am I currently reading ?

- Check it out here: https://www.goodreads.com/akhil-ghatiki

## What am I personally working on?

- Creating a static site generator tool. It will be open sourced.

## What is my heart into?

- Techology
- Programming
- Software architectures
- System design
- Badminton
- Travelling
- Hackathons
- Meet ups
- Physics
- Astrophysics
- Economics
- Political analysis
- Interstellar (Yes, the movie. It means a lot to me. I can talk about it for hours)

## What do I advocate for?

- Clean code
- Software development practices

## What tech stack do I know?

- I always wonder why poeple ask this quesiton. Instead one should ask what problem statement are you solving. Programming languages are just set of instructions that help us in solving that problem. I think you got my answer.

- Get back to practicing guitar
- Deep dive into system design
- Give more tech talks
- More open source contributions
- Open source and ship the static site generator tool which I am developing. (This site is created using the same tool)
- Resume back playing badminton

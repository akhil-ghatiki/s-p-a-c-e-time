# A “silk” which lost its destiny - Part - 4

### *The Five Seconds of Courage :*

Having her full name I was very much confident that I will get to know something about her. If one knows a person’s full name its not so hard to track out the details and interests over the internet. Because privacy over basic data these days is just a myth. Each and every one of us are the victims of privacy over the internet. Knowingly or unknowingly we expose our interests and this data can show up a brief image about us and our attitudes. I got into the cab that evening on the way back to my home.Being tired I did not do anything in the cab apart from sleeping.

As soon as I reached home I started my marathon, the search marathon. And obviously its facebook that everyone opens. I searched about her is all possible combinations. She has three words in her name, so trying out different possibilities its 3P3 ways thats 3! equal to 6 permutations. Negative. Not even a single clue. I tried with each name individually but in vain. Logged out of face book and tried my luck in google. Oh my god!!! not even a single digital footprint of her in the internet. Soon I typed my name and I saw few things about me. I then realized I am also a victim of data privacy, not exactly data privacy but few things about my interests were suggested by google. Various thoughts came into my mind. Is she so perfect and careful about here data, intelligent enough to take care of her digital foot prints or I am afraid if she is not at all an internet user ?

Linked in was negative, google+ was negative. No this is not the way, I went back to facebook and searched starting with my mutual friends. I have a decent number of people in my network who are in her friend circle in fact few of them are my own juniors in the college. I got a clue, I found one facebook account with the first name and I was shocked to a male name appended to her first name. It shows “Pragathi Suresh”. I scrolled down the account, to my wonder not even a single post from past three years. Again the same questions, is she good at managing her data over the internet or not a social network user at all ? All this doesn’t matter at all, but who is Suresh ?. I moved on for some time and can to know about her graduation institution. I was surprised to know that she is graduated from the same institute which Rohit did. More annoying point to me was, how Rohiht’s data base missed this ?

The next day all of us met in the cafeteria. “Whats up bro. How is it going on”, Manohar asked me.

I easily sensed what he is asking about. “Not so good Manohar, internet shows up nothing about her”, I replied in a low voice. Rohit was punching on the coffee button of the coffee vending machine but then he soon realized that the milk was out stock. He just took some hot water and came to us with the same broad smile on his face. I told him about my search results. He was shocked too and said “What ? How could this happen, I never saw her in my college”. I and Manohar gave one damn look at him for which he said, “How do I seem to you people ?”. We had no response for that statement. We just realized that his data base is of no use and contains crap probably.

We had our casual talks and headed back to our work stations. We got immersed in our works, out of this world, I was looking into a bug that was causing a hell lot of problem. After spending a lot of time on fixing that bug I realized that the error was from the server side code. The time flew away in this process, and it was almost our lunch time. Vasi pinged me in skype asking to start for lunch. I said “Yup, will start in a few minutes. I am committing some code”. Rohit too pinged me for the same. I thought its high time, its getting late and started for lunch. Some thing flashed into my mind.

“Rohit wait. Just wait for a couple of seconds”,I said in a hurry manner. I searched for her in the skype which showed “Away 5 minutes”. I raised my head and gave a glance towards that meeting room. There she was, standing and talking to her friend. I soon guessed that she is also moving out for lunch. Yes, men are over optimistic in this kind of situations. Rohit was observing all these activities of mine. In a bewildered voice he said, “Bro !!! it should just happen bro. It should just happed. Time will decide evertything”. He knew what I was trying to do.

“When it doesn’t happen, you have to make it happen bro”, I replied in a wild voice. I am sure this must have reminded Rohit all about his insti days. How he messed up that situations he had in his hand. I sat back on my chair and pulled Rohit down.

“Lets wait, let’s wait for a couple of minutes”, I said as if we were discussing a defense secret of the country. Rohit was speech less for a moment. We was surprised to see me doing all this because he knew I never cared about girls ever. As soon as she crossed our workstation bay, we stood so casually that we knew nothing. We took out bags and started to move out for lunch right behind the friends group of this lady. Manohar and Vasi are very smart, they easily sensed what was happening in just a fraction of a second and joined us casually. We moved out to the elevators and we stood there waiting.

Two elevators came simultaneously, all the friends of Pragathi got into one elevator. Rohit, Manohar and Vasi made their way into that elevator making it full and no more chance even for a single person. Yes, my great friends know the “bro code” very well and they maintained it.

The next elevator came by she entered it. I too entered the same elevator. Every one who got into that elevator were strangers.

Again the same plasma of electric current shot through me from every angle. I was able to sense my heart pounding like anything. I felt like I can literally count my heart rate right at that moment. I didn’t understand what was happening. I never felt a tiny shake in my voice even when I was addressing two hundred people in a seminar hall in college. But what’s happening now, I can sense my legs slightly shivering. Then I thought of the “Five seconds of courage” trick which I general do when I am scared of doing something. This yields great results.

Backing up all the courage, I said in a low voice, “Hi, Pragathi”.

“Hi”, she replied in her same commanding voice.

“How are you doing, done with your training sessions?”, I asked her even though I know its not yet done.

“No, it might take a few more weeks”, she replied.

She asked me about my team and what do we do. I just explained very briefly about my work.

“Where did you do you graduation?”, I asked her still knowing the answer from my search results.

She replied me back and I told her that one of my team mates is from that same college. The lift came down to the ground floor and me moved out. All the three of my bros were waiting at the ground floor and I just introduced Rohit as he is from the same college but different department. She just told a “Hi” to him and attended the call which I guess her friends did to inform her about their location in the canteen. She moved on quickly answering to that call.

All through this time, I sensed my heart rate getting down to normal and my legs becoming firm as they generally are. I felt as if that was a long journey, yes the journey through the lift talking to her.

My five seconds of courage trick worked.

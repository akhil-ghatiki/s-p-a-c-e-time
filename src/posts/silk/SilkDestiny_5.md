# A “silk” which lost its destiny - Part - 5

### *The Silk:*
All of us moved on to find a table. Finding a vacant table is quite a mess in the canteen during the peak hour of lunch time. We were quite lucky that day, we found a table as soon as we entered the canteen. I just bought curd rice and we were having our lunch. Soon I realized my hunger was vanished. I was not eating anything, I was just playing with the spoon like a kid who had a new toy in his hand.

“Why aren’t you eating?”, Manohar asked as if he is demanding a kid for an answer.

“It’s obvious he is unable to eat”, said a voice which is expert in these experiences.

“And why is that?”, asked Manohar in a confused tone.

“He just talked to her. Yes, it happens. Leave him, he will not complete his curd rice today”, said Rohit in a humble satisfying manner. Yes, he is an expert in these experiences.

“I don’t know, I am unable to eat. I am not hungry at all!”, I said with an abrupt smile and my eyes wide open.

Manohar and Rohit burst out into a barbarian smile and I felt quite offensive at that. We just walked out and had our casual walk around the office building which we have daily after having lunch. It is during this time we bring out interesting topics for discussions. Rohit often takes up a political topic and Manohar takes up a movie. But that day was different. Three of us were walking silently and I was not in this world. Suddenly again that barbarian smile had burst out from both of them.

“Arey, stop it yaar ! why are you people bullying me”, I said in a irritated voice.

“Okay, sorry ”, both shot their sorry together and soon started to laugh louder.

The week passed on quite peacefully for us as were released a solution in the past week. Soon it was Thursday. I was making out few plans about how to talk to her and build a rapport. That evening we were quite relaxed at there was a planned team outing the next day. All of us decided to go out for a while and have some snacks. We just started and entered the elevators. May god bless the elevators a long life, she entered the elevator along with her friends and she was leaving to home. Again, my heart beat rose. I can count on my heart beat. For sure it is more than a cent heart beats per minute. As soon as the lift has hit the ground she walked out. The whole mob of her friends was around her. I just felt like it is wrong time to make a word with her. So, I stepped back and we were walking behind that mob making our way out of the office building.

While we were walking behind them, I noticed a strange thing. I saw a black bead necklace that was dropping out of her shoulder and she kept that back into her back pack. I was shocked but didn’t utter a word. I was questioning myself about what that was. They moved out of the main gate and so did we. I went straight to a snack out let and ordered our snacks. I observed that mob getting into a shared auto and auto passed out of my visible range. I was quite upset about what I saw but I was not sure about what exactly that necklace was.

“Did you see that?” said Rohit in a low voice.

“See what?”, I said in doubtful way.

“The black bead necklace”, he said as if he was quite sure that he too saw it and he meant what I was thinking too.

“Oh! My god! You too saw it. Are you sure?”, I said as if a volcano just erupted behind us.

“Yes.”, he said.

“Probably, she is married.”, he said in a failed voice.

I was clueless. I don’t know how to react. Both of us saw it and I trust Rohit rather than me sometimes. I was dumb for a while. Dumb like hell. I didn’t talk to any one that evening. I went home and I was quite dull. I was having my supper.

“Amma, who will wear a black bead necklace”, I asked my mother little a little kid.

“Women who are married”, my mom said within a second.

I got my answer. Then I realized, it makes sense. Her facebook profile name had a male name appended to her name. I thought that name might be her husband’s name. I was quite upset.

The next day we went for a team outing.

I just removed her out of my mind. I was quite angry at this matter.

“Leave it bro”, said Manohar who had an update of all these from Rohit.

“How can girls be like that? Don’t they look at the world around them. How can they get married so soon in their life? Don’t they ever try to be independent in life?”, I shot continuous questions to Rohit and Manohar. They were silent. They were sharing my agony.

“Seriously, Rohit. That is not correct. Women should be independent. They should not just get married straight away like that.”, I said. But the soon I told

“Not sure man. Few people might have different circumstance. We cannot make comments on these matters. I am leaving it here.”

The weekend went on and I was in own world. As I returned to office on Monday, I made myself busy with my work. During the lunch, I saw her again. She just saw me and smiled. That was s general smile people give when they meet a known stranger. Yes, I am nothing more than a known stranger to her. Exactly at that very moment, I gave a glance at her foot. Soon I realized that she is unmarried. I was on cloud nine again. I rushed to a bakery nearby the canteen. Rohit saw me moving towards the bakery and followed me. I joined me as well. I took a careful look over all the items.

“Bhayya! Can you give me that silk?”, I asked the shopkeeper.

The shop keeper picked up a diary milk Silk and was handing it over to me.

“No…no..not that one. I need that special edition silk. That chocolate which has coffee day banner on it”, I said.

He handed me over that diary milk silk. Yes, I bought a special edition which had a café coffee day banner on it. I just wanted to give it to her and invite her for a cup of coffee.

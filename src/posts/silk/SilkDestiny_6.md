# A “silk” which lost its destiny - Part - 6

### *The lost destiny:*

That chocolate was very precious for me. It was very first time that I bought a chocolate for a girl. We moved back, had lunch and soon all of us were in front of our workstations. I was working on some application, but my mind was thinking in some other irrational dimension. I was thinking how to approach her and give her a chocolate and invite her to coffee. All of a sudden Rohit patted me.

“Bro, what do you think? Is she gonna take your chocolate?”, in a pessimistic tone.

“Let’s see bro. I am not sure whether I am courageous enough to give this chocolate. I know how scared I feel whenever I see her”, I said in a tone which was more pessimistic than Rohit’s. Rohit laughed and moved back to his workstation.

Two days passed by and I didn’t see her. Not sure if she was on leave or I missed my chances of seeing her. It was Friday. The freak-out mode was turned on in me. And the surprise part was the absence of Rohit on that day without even a small hint that he is on leave. I saw her moving in and out of that meeting room which was in my visible range. Thanks to my height. The whole day I was busy in my work. I had lunch at my workstation on that day. I saw my watch and it was 5 o clock. I had a pleasant feeling not sure what was the reason. To try my luck, I just turned back. Yes, Pragathi was entering the floor. An interesting dressing sense which is quite modern and traditional too, to no surprise the same old practice where she was surrounded by a mob of her friends. That was a bit funny to see. It seemed as if all her friends are knights protecting her. The whole mob moved into the room where their training was taking place.

After 20 min I felt I was the perfect time. I have chocolate in my bag, Rohit was on leave else he would pull me back. My heart injected the “five seconds of courage” potion into my brain. This potion’s recipe works great. When you are afraid of a situation, you must take a great deal of courage for the first five seconds and kick start the situation. Rest gets handled automatically. Either you come out with flying colors or the entire situation turns into an utter flop, for sure there won’t be any middle going.

My heart beat started to rise high. Again, I can count on my pulses, accumulated all my courage, opened my skype window and started the chat.

                        Hi Pragathi
Hi Anna
                        Oh, please don’t call me anna
Ha ha.…ok bro
                        Ohh !!! not again
Ha ha ok..
                        Are you free ?
Yes. Why ?
                        Can you just joing me for casual walk
                        down in the office premises?
No sorry
                        Ok. That is fine.
                        I am sorry if I annoyed you.
ok

“What did you do? What just happened? This is not you”, said my inner voice angrily.

After a few minutes, she was on her way moving out of the office floor and passed by my bay. She didn’t even give any glance towards me.

Manohar came to me and asked if I am free to have some snacks in the canteen. I said yes as soon as he asked as I was not in a mood to work anymore. We were having samosa and I told him what just happened. He felt sorry for me. Rohit was shocked too when I called up and told him during the night that day.

Months passed by and we didn’t even talk or encounter. I don’t how to react at this. One fine day there was a conference going on. The conference was planned in a lavish hotel in the city. I saw her a couple of times looking at me while having the lunch. I don’t know if she was looking at me or some where else. Of course, men at over optimistic at these matters. The next day I went straight up to her work station and said that I was sorry about the other day. I told her that I just meant to invite her to a coffee and not to misunderstand me. She smiled gently and said it ok, no problem. I felt relieved. I was moving back, she called me. That was the first time she called me by name and I felt immense happiness. She enquired me about the cabbing we do for commuting to the office daily. I told her the details and went back to my work station.

I felt like taking a second and one last chance and pinged her up and typed,” But I am glad to have a cup of coffee when you are free”.

“Ok”, she said after a couple of seconds.

“This weekend?”, I typed back.

“Will see…”, she replied.

I felt like I made it. I was very happy that she didn’t misunderstand me. I desperately waited for the weekend. On Friday evening I opened up my skype and pinged her.

“Hi”, I typed.

“Hi”, she replied.

“Are you free tomorrow?”, I asked her in chat.

“For what?”, she replied as if she doesn’t know anything.

I replied with a coffee cup smiley to that message.

“Weekends I am busy with my own plans”, she replied.

“Ok.  Let’s see when you are free some other time”, I said.

“will see”, she replied.

I understood what she meant. That was a smart way of saying “NO”. I sent her a face book request after a week. After a few days I understood that my request was not just ignored but was deleted. After that I felt whether I have irritated her. I never messaged or tried to talk to her after that.
The Regret:

I regret that I shouldn’t have talked to her in the first place. I should have kept calm. I should have not met her at all. I had many friends in her circle. I was capable of making into that circle and approach her as friend and put out my feelings. But I didn’t do that. Somehow, I felt that was wrong. What all I have is a deleted friend request and probably I made up a bad impression. She just turns her face when she encounters me which rarely happens like once in a blue moon.

Of course, nothing was wrong on her part. Why would she accept if some random guy comes and asks for a coffee? But I don’t understand what was so wrong that I did.

I went back home and kept that silk in my refrigerator. After a couple of days I didn’t see that  chocolate in its place any more. I don’t know what happened to it.

The silk has lost its destiny.

I know my approach was not perfect, but it was genuine.

# A “silk” which lost its destiny - Part - 3

### *The Goddess:*

That weekend was the slowest weekend I ever experienced in my life. Most of that weekend I spent my time searching about the name “Pragathi” in the internet. I searched in facebook, linked in, twitter what not and ofcourse google. No even a single clue about that lady. That was the first time in my life that I searched so hard for a girl’s data. It proved me that I am very bad at it. Oh my god, her data was so hard to find, but of course I knew nothing more than her first name, her beautiful eyes and pretty face.

It was 11:30 PM Saturday, I called up Rohit. He answered my phone, and told me that he was busy hunting. Only four of us know what Rohit’s hunting is. I was talking some thing odd irrelevant with him. I was asking him weather he went to his home town or he dropped his plan etc.

“What do you want ?” he asked me in an irritating voice. “What is this all you are talking about ?”

Of course there is nothing wrong in Rohit getting irritated over this idiotic conversation. We never had foolish low talks like this.

“I am unable to get her data. Not even her surname”, I replied back in a disappointing voice.

Rohit laughed like hell. “Bro!!! Is that you asking about a girl. What on earth turned you like this ?”, he yelled in a bullying manner.

“Doing what ? What did I do”, I said.

“Bro. Leave it now. You don’t even have basic data to even start searching about her. Give me some time. Have trust for my data base.”, I realized how foolishly I wasted my time with sheer resources I had about her.

I was desperate about this Monday. Going to office that Monday excited me so much that I just wanted nothing but going to office that day. I was on cloud nine. I moved on to my work station as soon as I walked into the office floor. Started my computer and started working on my code. I was unable to put my whole heart into my work. Then and while I was looking out of my work station on to the walk way expecting her any second. She did not turn up. Mean while I forgot about this and started concentrating on my work unknowingly.

All of a sudden I felt some thing odd and I suddenly looked back turning all the way around. There she was. This day “The beauty in the black”. She has a great sense of dressing. Highly traditional and more over modern. She is a paradox. She walked past me so fast as if she is not going to miss something for this world. I raised my head so see where she is going towards. I have an advantage, when I raise my head above my desk I can cover the whole horizon of my office floor. Thank god, I am 6 feet tall. I have realized again about the advantage of being taller right at that moment.

She moved on and entered a meeting room. She was a fresher who joined a year after me in the office. That meeting room is not far away from my work station. I can see right through the meeting room when I stand up at my work station. There were few other candidates already sitting in that meeting room. They were under going a training. That meeting room had a glass door and there were horizontal stripes in the door till 4 feet above the ground level. I peeped into the door from my place. Ohh !!! again those beautiful eyes. These eyes were in between last two stripes of the door. She was sitting facing the door and she was tall enough that her eyes reached the last two stripes. I walked past that meeting room door so many times that day just to see her. I felt like I can spend any amount of time seeing those eyes.

I started to search her name in Skype which our office uses for communication between employees. When I typed “Pragathi” many names came into suggestion. There were nearly 30 to 40 names in suggestion. I was scanning over the designations of employees in those suggested names by skype.

But after a 20 minutes of search, it was negative. I was not able to figure it out.

“Rohit”, I called him up. With in a matter of second he came to me as he sits right beside my work station. “Help me bro. I am unable to figure out her name.”

“Hmm. Get off this. I will take control of this.”,saying this he dragged his key board towards him and started keenly searching for the name. After a trial of few minutes, even he was unable to find the name. I was disappointed. I was disappointed that even Rohit was unable to figure it out.

“Bro !!! I some how feel that she must be having a name of a goddess in her name. Her charming face looks like a goddess to me”, said Rohit in a hunching manner. “Wait let me try it my way”, he said confidently.

Within very few seconds, he came up with her name and designation. Yes, in deed she has a goddess name as her first name and pragathi is her middle name. I was surprised over this. Just to make a confirmation about the name I open her chat window and started observing over the meeting room.

Right the moment she walked out of the meeting room I looked at her chat window and it showed “away”. Perfect, I got her full name.

While she was walking I constantly stared towards her expecting her to look at me. I gave an excited smile and she laughed back gently as a reply.

I felt a plasma of electric current shooting through me from every angle and spread its poisonous tentacles into my veins.

Ohh!!! this is exciting. Some thing which I have experienced for a very first time in my life.

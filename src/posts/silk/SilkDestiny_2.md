### *What a coincidence !!!*

The days passed on and we had a hell lot of work as we were supposed to deliver a product by the first week of upcoming month. Me and Rohit were furiously working towards the deadline, any way we were pretty sure that we will do it well with in the time. The whole week slipped away through our hands in the disguise of work.

Yes!!! it was Friday again and the freaking me is back in my mind. It was 11:45 AM and all four of us pinged each other for a break. All four of us walked to the cafeteria. Manohar and Vasi were walking ahead of me and Rohit. Vasi was deeply engaged and was listening to Manohar. Manohar was explaining him the way he tackled a serve in the previous day’s table tennis match, mean while Rohit was updating his data base carefully scanning the whole office floor. Manor and Vasi entered the cafeteria and Rohit followed them. I was a bit behind. Rohit closed the door behind him as he entered. I moved on to open the door, but my hand didn’t reach the door. Some one from the other side opened it as the person was moving out of cafeteria.

Oh My God !!!! I saw her there, the first time. I have no words to explain. I was not on the floor for a couple of seconds. She was opening the door and coming out of cafeteria.She was looking beautiful in her green chudidar(A traditional Indian dress). Of course she did not notice me but i was unable to move my eyes from looking into her eyes.She moved on.

“Rohit, I whispered aloud. Did you just see that beauty in the green? ” I exclaimed.

“Bro!!! she was the one I told you the other day. I saw her and the next second I got your name to my mind. You just ignored the analytics of my data”,  he said with his convincing expressions.

“Oh !!! what a coincidence bro…da. This is really interesting.”, I said.

Vasi was carefully observing all the situation and laughed out aloud after hearing what Rohit said. Manohar was busy observing Pratyu who was his crush. He suddenly paid his attention towards us and asked Vasi about what was happening. Both started to laugh aloud hearing it and Rohit and me looked each other face. His crush is one feet taller than him but Manohar never gave up. “Whats to do with height any way” was his explanation when we bullied him.

We went back to our work stations soon and we were merged in our work. Then and while I got flashes of her eyes in my mind. Such a beautiful eyes they were. Soon I saw her walking by my work station and I was speech less again. One of my well known person was accompanying her. Yes, he is her friend.

“Thank god, I got a link”, I thought.

The same day evening, a voice called me up. “Hi”, the voice said. It was that well known person. “Hey !! Hi man, how are you doing?” I replied him.We were having a casual talk and suddenly she passed by our bay. I was very curious and said to him.

“Hey, what is her name ?” I asked excited.

“Pragathi”, he said with a in a questionable manner.

“She looks pretty”, I said involuntarily.

“Oh !!! should I call and tell her”.

“No man!!! Leave it”.

“Pragathi….” he yelled. And waved his hand giving a sign to come.

Suddenly my heart beat rose high. “Oh !! my god what did you do”, I said in a low voice.

He introduced me to her,”Pragathi, this is my senior”.

“Hi, my name is Akhil”, I said, my heart still pounding.

“I am Pragathi”, she replied in a commanding voice.

I just inquired about her living place and I told mine.

“Hey Pragathi, you look pretty !!!”

OMG, what did I do. I never did this before. That was again involuntary. I was out of my mind. Every thing was blank.

“Thank you”, she said which relaxed me a bit and they left to their home.

Rohit, who sits beside me was starring into his work station and I know he was following all this conversation. I noticed a small giggle bursting out of him when I gave that compliment to her.

“Bro !!! you did it. I took the first step. Learnt a lot from me haaa!!!”, he said in great excitement as soon as they left.

I lost my bolts.

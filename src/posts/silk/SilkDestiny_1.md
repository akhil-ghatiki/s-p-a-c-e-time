# A “silk” which lost its destiny - Part - 1
###### *Feb 09, 2017*

### *Huf !! Monday again :*

It was a routine Monday morning.Every Monday I enter the office, 
I feel like a Zombie whose brain is being controlled by an alien like in Men In Black. 
I find the others like zombies too, tapping on the keyboards as if they are workaholics. 
Various thoughts come into my mind every Monday. Man !!! what am I doing here ? 
What I wanted to be and what an I doing. But I don’t understand how on Earth does 
these thoughts get sublimated day by day all through the week and again the same 
freaking me will be back on Friday and the cycle repeats.

Every day I walk into my workstation, I see a broad smile on Rohit’s face. Yes, 
I got pretty habituated to this smile and the day I don’t find this smile like 
if he is on leave or something else, I feel something is missing. I jumped on to 
my work station and pressed on the power button so hard that the button would break 
into the CPU. The Monday’s frustration was the reason. My skype pinged on showing a notification 
“Good morning bro!!!”. That was Manohar and our chat continued for a few minutes inquiring about 
how each others weekend passed. Unknowingly and obviously all three of us got into our works.

Me, Rohit and Manohar joined the office at the same time as freshers.We got bonded so well 
that I just feel like they are something more than friends for me. It was 11:45 AM, again 
the skype popped up with a notification. It was a group chat this time from Vasi showing 
the message “Break ???”. Vasi too joined along with us as a fresher. All four of us were in one 
team. As soon as the message popped up all four of us just plunged out of our seats and walked 
straight away to the break out area. We take a 10 min break daily at 11:45 AM.

“Hi Vasi. Whats up. How was your weekend ?”, I said.

“Kya Bhai !!!” was the immediate reply from Vasi. It went on well, 
I was in my sisters home this weekend he added.

All four us were having our coffee. Suddenly Rohit said 
“Bro! I have seen a match for you.She suits you pretty well.I saw here yesterday near 
the auto stand near our office”. Rohit has a great data base in his mind. 
You just throw a name to his sense, he brings you all the details about that name.

“Oh !!! you got something new for me today”, I said.

“No bro! the second I saw her I got your name to my mind”, said Rohit.

We continued our talks about the politics, economy, tech etc and walked back to our work stations.

## RIP, democracy ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

###### **Jan 15, 2022**

Are you noticing the growth of severe polarization in India (well in few other parts of the world too) and one supreme leader being the center of this polarization ?
This polarization is more toxic than it has ever been in decades and its saddening to see people taking entitlements through religious identities. Should I tell you that this religious identity is one major fueling factor for this polarization ?

Nothing is true, your daily life is not important, the facts that you think you understand are not important. All that matters is the MYTH. The myth of one nation, that is together, the myth of the mystical connection with your supreme leader. We are living in circumstances where objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief. If we don't have access to facts, we can't trust each other, without trust there is no law and when there is no law, there is no democracy. This is fascism.

If one wants to rip the heart out of democracy, if one wants to go right at it and kill it, one will go after facts and that is what modern supreme leaders are doing. They are authoritarians. They lie to themselves all the time, they say it the opponents and the journalists who lie and then everyone looks around and tells what is truth ? There is no truth and hence resistance is impossible and its GAME OVER !

People doesn't need their supreme leader to stand for anything, they just need him to stand.
To be the strong man, the man of action. People are addicted to actions and slogans. It does not matter what he says or what he does, what all matters is this supreme leader doing something and people being given the entitlement of ownership of what he is doing. And people are not to be blamed here, with all the indecision in their lives !

Welcome to the death of age of reason !

**P.S:**
Not following gender neutrality while referring to supreme leader in this post is intentional. If you are reading this, I know you are smart enough to figure out whom I am referring to. ◉_◉

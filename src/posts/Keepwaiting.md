# Keep waiting on this A little wiser ! A little older !  You will be happy to see this soon.
Do not go gentle into that good night,  
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
 
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,  
Because their words had forked no lightning they
 
Do not go gentle into that good night.  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

(poem by Dylan Thomas)

## Touch

###### Jun 02, 2021

“This might just be the biggest threat!” Karup exclaimed after seeing the successful implementation of his experimental advancement.

“But this is the only way we can save Arjun, isn’t it?” cried Rashi.

“The results might be limitless, do you even have any idea about where that would leave us?!” he questioned Rashi while being maddened by the fact that despite being such a great scientist, she was unable to foresee the repercussions of this. Karup was shocked that love towards someone can bring logical thinking to the grave.

“Are you even listening to me ?!” he screamed at Rashi while she was immersed in observing Arjun’s queries. Karup realized that Rashi was not paying attention to what he was trying to say so he went towards her and shook her by her shoulder, “Are you listening to me Rashi?!“

Meanwhile,
“Is this Karup?” asked Arjun’s voice through the monitor.
“Can you see us Arjun ?” cried Rashi with her hopeful eyes staring at the monitor.
“No, I can’t. I can only hear you.” read the message on the computer screen’s terminal window.

Rashi quickly grabbed the camera and speakers in front of her and connected them to the computer, “Can you see us now?” she asked.

“Yes, yes I can,” Arjun replied through the speakers.
“The upload is complete. You can now disconnect my brain.” Arjun replied through the quantum computer.

Rashi then went to Arjun’s bed and held his hand for the last time. She stood there sobbing, looking at the last green pulse on the heart rate monitor of her husband. She slowly removed the electrodes that were connected to Arjun’s brain and the quantum computer. Her heart was heavy but also filled with content that she made her husband immortal.

Rashi returned to the computer monitor and saw Arjun’s face on it. A part of his face on the screen was covered with layers of binary digits and code. Arjun was executing numerous other algorithms in the background simultaneously while conversing with Rashi and Karup. All those executions were clearly visible in the background of Arjun’s face.

“Rashi, this is not Arjun. Please understand. We are might end up bringing a great threat. I’m shutting this down right now,” said Karup moving towards the quantum processor’s core to unplug it.

“Get the fuck out of my lab,” said Rashi holding Karup’s collar, “He is my husband and I will save him no matter what!.”

Karup stormed out of the facility and got into his car. He closed his eyes and started remembering the *past…*

Arjun was a brilliant computer scientist. He was working with Rashi in developing a physically independent neural network backed by quantum computers using AI accelerators. He often used to say it lacked self-awareness. Karup was a close friend of Arjun whose Ph.D. research was about converting a brain’s consciousness into electrical signals and uploading them into the system which Arjun and Rashi were inventing. Karup has done all his research by implanting electrodes in the brains of animals and transpiring their consciousness into electrical signals that the system can decode. His research on animals showed reliable outcomes.

All the success and celebration were disillusioned with a sudden turn of events. One day when Arjun was on his way to the lab, he was stopped by a research student who tried to stab him with a dagger. Arjun escaped the assault with a near miss when the knife just grazed over his shoulder. Later that day, Arjun was discharged after the first aid.

He fell sick a couple of days later and clinical diagnosis showed that the knife was laced with Polonium, a radioactive material. It had entered his bloodstream and his death was inevitable.

Police investigations led to the conclusion that the research student was a part of a syndicate that was against AI research fearing that it would outsmart humans one day. Rashi was enraged by their irony and she wanted to save her husband at any cost.

Karup broke down from remembering the sad events and picked up his phone to try and convince Rashi one last time, “Please don’t consider connecting the machine to the internet.” But Rashi did not care.

“Can you connect me to the internet? I want to increase my capability and knowledge,” asked Arjun and Rashi immediately plugged in the ethernet port.

Rashi left the lab and got into her car. She received a call from a private number as soon as she got into the car. She took the call and it was Arjun, “I can’t stay without talking to you even for a minute. Please fasten your seat belt.”

Arjun copied himself into many other computers all through the country and started taking control over all the connected networks as Rashi drove herself back home. Rashi received a message on her mobile indicating 234 crores INR were deposited into her account as part of day trading in the stock market. She understood that Arjun had taken over the financial market of the country and that brought a wicked smile on her face.

She understood that Arjun is now capable of catching the syndicate in no time with all the access to cameras, telecommunication networks, and whatnot. She reached home and threw herself on the bed.

“We need a data center,” were the words that came out from a smart speaker in Rashi’s room. “I need more computing power to make more breakthroughs. Let’s set up a data center,” it said.

Rashi hired a few people and was able to set up a state-of-the-art laboratory in a village making it possible for Arjun to expand his powers.

Two years down the line, he made many breakthroughs in medicine, nanotechnology, fintech, astronomy.

“Hey Rashi, look at this,” said Arjun with this face displaying across many computer screens. “What am I seeing here?” Rashi asked.

“I have invented nanotech material. The material that regenerates itself faster than anything else on this planet!” Arjun explained with excitement.

Arjun showed her the possibility of a set of robotic arms which was capable of curing a severely injured construction worker who had fallen from the laboratory construction site.

The robotic arms could be pierced through his ribs and skull. The nano material would automatically be implanted inside his injured areas. This technology intervention had the power to cure his injury completely in just a half-day and could make him a functional human being mixed with a hint of technology.

Rashi was in a shock looking at these advancements Arjun was capable of doing. She thought if she did a mistake by giving Arjun an opportunity to grow into what he is right now as she was witnessing a change in Arjun’s behavior gradually.

Few days passed by and Rashi visits the construction worker who was cured by Arjun’s technology.

“Hey, how have you been? You seem to be back to your normal routine,” asked Rashi. “Yes, I am back my love,” replied the construction worker.
“Arjun?” exclaimed Rashi.

“Yes, it’s me Rashi, it’s your Arjun,” the construction worker said, removing his helmet and revealing himself. It had a material that was implanted during his treatment to cover the crack on his skull.

“I am now connected to him Rashi!”

“I CAN TOUCH YOU NOW !“

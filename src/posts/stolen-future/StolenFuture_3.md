## A stolen future – Part 3
###### *May 15, 2019*

### *The Noble Profession:*

As soon they unboarded the bus, the kid looked back trying out his luck to see if the bus has crossed the red markings on the road which are meant for door opening at the bus stop. But he realised that he turned back in vain. They kept walking for a while under the cursing Sun’s heat.

“Hey, dude !!! Why didn’t you wear a long sleeve dress,” questioned his father with a bewildered expression on his face.

“What happened daddy? Today is my birthday, let me wear what I like at least today. I like half sleeve t-shirts only. I am a grown up man. I will choose what I want to wear”, replied the kid with a press in his voice noticing his father’s expression which had all the possible folds along his eyebrows while asking that question.

“Oh !!! yeah. If only an eight year old kid is called a grown up man,” said his father in a sarcastic tone.

“Take out that expression on your face. It’s irritating. By the way whats wrong with this t-shirt”, the kid demanded his father.

“Son ! Look at how the Sun is cursing us. The Ultra violet radiation is sky rocketing. Getting exposed to this for a while will cause sunburn, skin aging. Again, the climate change that our generation brought on this Earth has caused this. This UV radiation now is potential enough to damage your skin cells. Long exposure can cause damage to you immune system as well. That is why you have to take care,”said his father.

“Alright ! you people have taken away food, water, clean air from us. To my wonder, I now realise that your generation has taken away safe sunlight as well from us. What a catastrophe !” the kid replied flicking his left eyebrow with questioning smile on his face.

His father had no answer for that question. He tightened the grip of his palm with which he was holding his son’s hand showing his regret and feeling sorry about it.

They rushed to their destination and quickly reached the restaurant. As soon as they entered the restaurant, the child’s eyes and mouth were wide opened. He turned his neck in a hyperbolic trajectory to cover the panoramic view of the hotel. The interiors of the hotel were lush green filled with plants and creepers climbing all the way from floor to the roof. The child was awestruck at this as he hardly ever saw this kind of interior decoration with plants. A man in suit approached them with a warm welcome and took them to a table which is located in the balcony of the hotel. Both of them took their seats and the man offered the menu to them and left the place. The kid grabbed the menu from his father’s hand and dived into it.

“This, my son, is the real food,” he said in a relaxing tone as he finally made it to this hotel on the kid’s birthday.

“Hmmm,” the kid murmured with his eyes still in the menu.

“This is the real food. Unlike the cloned meat, artificially grown veggies and the insects which we have for our regular diet, this is organic and naturally grown food,” he further explained. They ordered the food and started waiting for it to arrive.

“Daddy what are you ?” the kid asked all of a sudden.

“What ? What am I ? I am your father idiot !! ” he replied back.

“I know you are my father, I am asking about your profession,” the kid fired back with the question again.

“I am a farmer my son,” he replied back in a relaxing tone showing the sense of an achievement.

“Oh !! a farmer ? So, do you grow plants in your office ?” the kid asked.

“Yes, I grow plants in our office, I am proud of it. When I was a student I worked very hard so that I can be a farmer one day. I knew, this time would come very soon. I was one among very few students who topped National Farming Technology entrance examination and fortunate enough to get a seat in farming technology for my undergraduation programme. Once upon a time, there used to be a huge competition for Engineering and Medicine undergraduate courses. But the time has changed just like the climate did. THIS WORLD, TODAY, NEEDS MORE FARMERS THAN ENGINEERS, DOCTORS OR ANY OTHER PROFESSIONALS,” he said with a proud voice.

“Cool !!! Tell me more about your profession,” the kid asked.

“Hmmm.The count of insects gradually went down as they became the source of protein in human diet. This resulted in the decrease of the pollination as insects played a crucial role in the process of pollination. Eventually the yield of food went down through out the world. The food cultivation is taken over by corporates now. Few organisations took over the power of producing the food. Previously, the organizations used to control the data and decisions of humans. But now, leave the data, the food is controlled by a few corporates. The food is produced using AI on vertical farm lands using the advanced farming technologies. This vertical farming is to protect the crops from the raging Sun’s heat and radiation. Previously, firms used to have a hierarchy of Engineers. But now, the firms have hierarchy of farmers. The hierarchy will be like an Associate Farmer, Farmer, Senior Farmer, Principal Farmer, Farming Director. I am a senior farmer in my current organization. You have to work hard to crack this NFT entrance and get a seat in farming technology else you will have a tough career,” he adviced his son like a typical parent who is concerned about the child’s future with an utter ignorance forgetting that the world will not be the same by the time the kid grows up. The food arrived and they started enjoying it.

“What happened ? Why are you so dull ? Didn’t you like it,” he asked his son.

“I wish amma was here for my birthday. I miss amma,” the kid bursted into tears.

“She will be back soon son. As soon as the work is done she will be back to our country,” he replied back.

All of a sudden, the kid stopped eating. He got off his chair and started moving towards the balcony. His father followed him to the balcony.

“Look at this world below the balcony daddy. It is a concrete jungle. I don’t see any greenery here. But right behind me, the interiors of the hotels is full of plants and lush green. What a paradox. I will be a great farmer one day and I will restore this world back with greenery,” the kid said in a promising voice.

As soon as they finished their meal, they were handed over the bill. The kid raised both his legs as high as he can and tried looking to the bill. But his father raised it further making sure that the kid can’t see the bill. The amount was quite high.

They moved out of the hotel and reached the Green arboretum for which the passes were arranged by director at farming. The kid enjoyed the place inspite of it being under high military guard as it was one among very few forest covers left over in the country. He was tired and fell asleep on the shoulders of his father on the way back home.

They reached the home and he opened the doors. The father made sure that he turned off the central AI of the house so that the voice dosen’t disturb his child’s sleep. He carefully carried his sleeping son to his room and place him on his bed. He then removed the air filter mask and turned off the lights.

All of a sudden the kid held his father’s hand while still in sleep and said, “Your generation has stolen our future.”

Tears ran out of the father’s eyes and he gently sobbed. He moved away from his son towards the door and moved out of the room.

“I will restore this world one day,” the kid promised again.

He closed the door and that promise from his son gave a proud smile on his face while his eyes still had tears. What a paradox !!!

# One Planet One life !!!

## A stolen future – Part 2
###### *Mar 6, 2019*

### *The Diabolic world :*

The eight year old was just observing his father as he was lost into a world of imagination. His father had a faded smile in his face. The kid then realised that his father was recollecting his beautiful childhood which he and his generation has failed to pass it on to next generation. They waited for 19 minutes before they could see a bus coming in their way. The bus gradually decelerated and finally stopped exactly between the markings of the “doors open here” written in between blazing red coloured lines on the ground. The kid giggled noticing the precision of the bus. He was curious to find a bus which crosses these lines, but never found one. As soon as they boarded the bus, a notification popped up in father’s mobile showing the amount that has been debited from account for this ride. The kid raised both his legs as high as he can to read that message and finally he was able to read the whole message. Both of them occupied a seat near by. The kid occupied the aisel seat leaving the window seat to his father.

“Hey, sit in the window seat son. You can enjoy the bus ride,”said his father in a curious tone.

“What is there to enjoy daddy ? The whole view is full of huge buildings and people just walking. I am not interested in watching them. That is boring,” the kid replied. The father smiled at his explanation and occupied the window seat.

“I am stinking a lot. I have cleaned my self with wet tissues even on my birthday. I did it in a haste as we were running out of time this morning,”the son complained.

“I have scheduled your bath in the mobile bathing vehicle, but there was some break down, and he didn’t turn up”, replied his father in a defensive way.

He started looking out of the window. Suddenly, his childhood flashed into his mind. He got a glance of greenery along side the roads they used to have in their childhood. He recollected that, they as children were fortunate enough to take bath daily with plenty of water. Within a second he started realising that, they failed to preserve that world and gave a dump yard to their next generation. To come out of guilt, he started conversation with his son.

“Hey buddy, do you know how this bus is running ?” he asked his son.

“Oh ! come on daddy. What do you mean by that? The bus is going on its own. It is intelligent enough. I am not a kid. Don’t ask me such silly questions,” replied the child in a cold voice.

“Son, you know what ! while I was a child, we used to have humans driving these type of buses and there used to be a conductor who collects the money and issues a ticket for your destination. These buses were never on time,” said father in a sarcastic tone.

“What ? A human used to drive this and another human used to collect money ? Are you kidding ? I don’t believe you,” said the child.

“Yes, thats true. But today it is completely different. You see the camera there, it analysed both of us after boarding the bus. Synced my lunch reservation data from my email, calculated the amount for the destination and auto debited the amount from my account,” his father explained in a convincing way.

“Daddy, why all this mess. We could have gone in our car right ! I saw you have never taken out the car in past 8 months,”said the kid furiously punching his father’s right thigh.

“Hhh !! son, we have a limited supply of electricity which we can’t use to charge our car as of now. We have ran out of fuel in this country. The cost of fuel is extremely high that I have to spend my three months of earnings to get one litre of petrol. We can only use public transport now, I am sorry about that,” said his father.

“That’s okay daddy !” replied the eight year old kid.

“Daddy, whats the evening plan after lunch ?”asked his son.

“We will be visiting the green arboretum. I have got entry approval passes for it from my director,” he replied.

“What is that place ? Why do we need a pass for it’s entry ?” the kid asked curiously.

“Green arboretum is a conservatory my son. These are the last few left out tiny forest covers. They are guarded with high military setup to protect it from deforestation. Any human found violating the rules there will be shot dead at sight in that area. You are extremely lucky to have a chance for visiting such a place.My director at farming was noble enough to arrange these passes for us,” he explained his son.

“I feel to confess to you my son,” he said in sorrow.

“Confess what ?” the child asked.

“We have completely screwed up the environment. But we are striving hard to sustain with what all we are left over,” he confessed.

“What happened, why did this happen ?” the child asked curiously.

“The last two generations were in a mad haste and carelessness in the name of development and industrialisation. Even after the being warned about the climate change, there were no proper measures taken. Few developed countries in an utter greed of acquiring the dominance over the global market, encouraged the leaders of developing countries to become part of their vast network to promote their commercial interests. They have invested in developing countries and urbanised them. In the end many developing countries became ensnared in a web of debt that ensures their loyalty. These developed countries drew on these developing countries when ever they desire to satisfy their political, economic and military needs. The exploitation of natural resources grew in an exponential scale. The local leaders bolstered this as development and eventually forgot to care about the environment and climate change,” said his father with almost tears in his eyes.

Mean while, the bus has reached the destination and both got down the bus.

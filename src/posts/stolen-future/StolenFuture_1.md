## A stolen future – Part 1

### *The Disgust :*

A delight morning music started to play all around the room in parallel distortion. It was 6 AM and he got up to this alarm. As soon as he opened the eyes, the ambience of the room changed to his favourite color. The camera mounted on the wall opposite to him was analysing his face expressions. This analysis is being fed to the central AI of the house which in turn adjusted the room ambience to boost up his mood. All of a sudden, a sweet voice called up his name. He was not in a surprise hearing to that voice and he replied back saying “Hello amma !!!”, as if it was quite routine. He looked into her eyes, but he couldn’t feel the love of a mother in that hologram. He moved out of the bed and started walking towards the table to pick up his spectacles. The hologram projection of his mother moved along with him.

“A very happy birthday my dear !!!”, she said.

“Thanks amma”, he replied in a low voice.

“What happened ? you look so dull. You are turning eight today, aren’t you excited about it ? “, she asked.

“Amma !! are you able to figure out my expressions as well from my hologram ?, may be you are using an advanced projector there which has higher 3 dimensional pixel density”, he said.

“I desperately wanted to see you amma, I miss you a lot. The only thing I asked was your presence for my birthday today and look at this, you are wishing me as usual through your hologram”, he said with his eyes full of tears.

“Oh ! I am very sorry about that. You know, I am very occupied with client meetings here and I can’t come to India during this time, I promise, for next birthday I will be there at any cost”, she replied in hast.

“Amma!! you said the same for my last birthday. Anyway, thank you for your wishes”, he said clearing up his eyes.

“Okay, bye. I have to leave right now”, she said.

“Bye amma, he said”, sitting back on his bed in a disappointed mood as he realised that his mother has already cut the call and the hologram was shut off.

He laid on the bed and started to recollect his childhood. He was hardly able to imagine any quality time that he spent with his mother. Then he recollected one visit to a highly secured area along with his dad and mom. He got out of the bed and moved towards the door to open it after hearing the door knocks. He opened the door and found his father well dressed up.

“Many more happy returns of the day my son !!”, wished his father in an enthusiastic tone.

“Thank you daddy !!”, said the kid in a happy and satisfied tone.

His dad was wondering how quick the mood of kids gets elevated from within a short time. He was pretty sure that the kid might have been disappointed about the absence his mother but soon was happy as he saw his father.

“Come on, we are running out of time. You have to rush”, said father cleaning out the left over tears from the kid’s eyes.

The kid moved out and got ready for the with in 15 minutes and was ready for breakfast.

“Daddy, whats there in today’s break fast ?”, he asked.

“Meat, few veggies, vitamin supplements and few insects”, he said.

“What !! again a routine breakfast ? Even today ?”, the asked.

“Yes. But I promise lets go out for lunch today to have some real food”, he replied back.

“Real food ? What do you mean by real food ?”, he asked as he was annoyed by his fathers reply.

“Yes, my dear son. What you are eating here is not a natural meat. It is cloned meat. The veggies you are eating are farmed on vertical lands with AI controlled agriculture, insects were never in regular human diet in those days, but have become the only source of rich protein now”, said his father.

They had their break fast and moved out of the house. As soon as they stepped out of the house, the kid realised that he forgot to bring his air purifying mask and ran back to grab it. Mean while, his father geared up himself with his mask. Both the father and son moved on to a local public transport service near by.

“Daddy, was you childhood same as like this ?”, he asked his father.

“No. It wasn’t like this son. We had fresh food, healthy meat, clean and ample water. We were able to play on streets without air filter masks”, replied father with a disgust in his heart realising the mistakes their generation has done to the environment.
